# What is So_long?

It's the first graphical project in the course. So_long consists of a top-down game, which we code in C, using the MiniLibx graphical library. It involves a series of validations from the map that is passed as argument, checks to prevent memory leaks, the game engineering, managing windows, events, change images, maps, etc.
